I am using virtual machine as my testing labs and KVM as the hypervisor managed by Virt Manager.

I am choosing KVM because currently a lot of company already moving to KVM. So, I want to get familiar with it so that I am able to figure out how it works, basic tools and commands to install and manage it and also basic troubleshooting.

There are Windows, Linux and also Solaris VMs in my testing environment. I am using it if I want to do some testing like OS upgrade, database upgrade and also testing some scenario before implement it in production. I also installed FreeBSD vm and using it as ZFS storage. I am using that VM as shared storage to setup and test cluster environment like Oracle RAC database and also setup nested KVM environment to test on VM live migration using KVM.
